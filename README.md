# Prediction of Emergency Room Readmissions for new patients
Machine Learning classification for Healthcare optimization

## Problem
![](Images/pie.png)
Hospital readmissions place a huge strain and cost on current healthcare systems. If clinicians are able to have a sensing on the pribability that a patient readmits, they will be able to take steps to mitigate this billion dollar healthcare problem.

Traditional, explainable machine learning models are used in this patient classification prboblem
